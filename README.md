# URL_Shortener

I wanted to learn the programming language go, so I made a small application. Note that I don't have a domain, so if you copy the shortened link it won't work

## Features

- **shortens link**: If you enter a long link it will shorten the link.

## Installation

**VERY IMPORTANT**: start the go file not the html file

1. copy the github repository
2. start the go file.
